# publicly_opinionated
### Opinion > Fact > Debate > Opinion
##### thoughts, a call to act, and you.

An homage to my mentor [Michael T Miyoshi](http://www.michaeltmiyoshi.com/).

Feel free to purchase his book:
[Musings of a Mediocre Man](http://providence-foundation.org/content/fb2-michael-t-miyoshi-excellent-musings-mediocre-man-free)

Yes, you can also find his works for free online.  Its kindof the theme of this whole thing :D

#### What makes me so special?
I'm Not!  Thats the fun part, I'm just a learned young man of the middling class.  I have opinions, based on `facts`.  My opinions could be objectively wrong (bad `facts` or a boogieman word [stereotypes](http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/stereotypes)).  OR! It could be cause I didn't have the knowledge YOU have.  Cause you lived/felt/talked-to/understood the situation better than me.  Is that you?  Then PLEASE fork my OPEN SOURCE MIT licensed repo and file a `PULL REQUEST` EPIC CAPS LINE!

#### Why are you here?
A stranger probably linked you here.  Either that or you are one of the 5 people who actually end up
listening (because they know me).

#### Core Philosophy
1.  [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) (help, as you can.  never harm)
2.  Form `opinions`, which are not funtementally worse than `fact`
3.  evaluate your opinions based on YOUR perfect information (you can always find more on Google~)
4.  evaluate your opinions in leu of NEW information (provided by tv, peers, or other sources)
5.  Think, be yourself, and have fun.

#### To do lists
- [X] does this work? it does!
- [X] scaffold out dir structure
- [ ] convert audio into something that sounds better
- [ ] break it into parts? maybe.. I like as-is (convince me otherwise)
- [ ] transcribe to text the audio (programatically would be best, open source please!)
- [ ] get personal website to not be broken
- [ ] remind people to try out Linux distro "https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=186" (LMDE 2 "Betsy") Check the `sha` before installing.
