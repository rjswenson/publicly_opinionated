#### Donald Trump is not 2D

Lets not forget our frame of mind right now as Humans:

    “People sometimes imagine that just because they have access to so many
    newspapers, radio and TV channels, they will get an infinity of different opinions.
    Then they discover that things are just the opposite: the power of these
    loudspeakers only amplifies the opinion prevalent at a certain time, to the
    point where it covers any other opinion.” 
    ― Amin Maalouf, The First Century After Beatrice


    “Mass communication--wonder as it may be technologically and something
    to be appreciated and valued--presents us wit a serious danger, the danger
    of conformism, due to the fact that we all view the same things at the same
    time in all the cities of the country. (p. 73)” 
    ― Rollo May, The Courage to Create
