#### Best Pitches So Far

###### I have been rolling around in my head how to describe this almost insane idea of going from a teacher to student to cook to programmer.  This project is an outcropping of that wild ride.  Here are my best pitches so far.

- Our lives have been pretty jet-set lately. We've between the both of us had 4~5 flights in the past month.

I did want to share something with all you sharp and critical minds. I am working on a project very akin to James 's idea for a hive-mind approach to debate with opportunity for opinion change. The difference is that my project is very oriented about the right to be opinionated based on the facts known and the unknown ahead.

Its part manual to life(hacks), part blog, part opinionated podcast

If you peeps have Github accounts (which are free and you should get one at https://desktop.github.com/ ) you can star my project and passively get updates. Right now, there's just a basic README and some stubbed out directories. Eventually all the .md files will be filled with text. Also I've recorded about 4 hours of unedited audio to make into opinion/fact knowledge bombs.

With Github, my goal is for people to fact check my docs and audiocasts and file pull requests(addendum/fixes). Id love either online commentary about my README or some topic in particular you'd like to hear about.

ninjaedit: you can click on my link and look at the page without any login or anything at any time on any device known to man including but not limited to a Raspberry Pis running SteamOS.



- Been pretty quiet since Christian dropped the hammer in 2014.  I am a Duvall/Cedarcrest grad and am creating a FREE, no money'd business art and tech project.  It is heavily inspired by one of my favorite teachers at the school, Michael T Miyoshi.  Anyone can look, read, and consider the theories behind the project.  If you want show a monicrum of support, simply click the star in the upper right corner of the GitHub screen.  Again, all this is perfectly free.
